# Project Overview
This repository contains scripts and code used to analyze medium coverage whole-genome sequence data from two Cardinalis species, each sampled in an urban and rural context.

### Central Question
How does urbanization affect two closely related species that differentially respond to urbanization?

Northern cardinals seem slightly more tolerant of urbanization than pyrrhuloxia, despite existing in very similar ecological niches in the absence of hunam disturbance. We modeled this in Maxent as the foundational justification for this project in a paper that is still in revision (see Spatial_Github for relevant code and latest draft). 

The analyses aim to identify selection on each species in an urban context. We ran Fst, dxy, Tajima's D, and RAiSD. The first two tests directly compare urban and rural populations. The latter two populations independently look for signals of selection in the urban population and the rural population, and then considers signals exclusive to the urban population to be suggestive of selection due to urbanization

NOCA or noca: northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis)
PYRR or pyrr: pyrrhuloxia (Cardinalis sinuatus)

### Acknowledgements
This project is the 4th chapter of my dissertation, which I defended in September 2023. It is a collaboration between myself, my advisor Kevin McGraw (Michigan State University), Scott Taylor (University of Colorado), and Sabrina McNew (University of Arizona). I am very grateful for the support and feedback of the other members of my dissertation committee: Gro Amdam and Karen Sweazea (Arizona State University. All sequence data wille be available on the Sequence Read Archive upon publicaton.
