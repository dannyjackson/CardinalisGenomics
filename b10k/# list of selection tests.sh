# list of selection tests

1. fst
2. dxy
3. tajimas d
4. raisd

Considering:
Change in allele frequency
    If we assume strong selection leads to fixation only in urban pops, couldn't we just look at direct differences in allele frequency in rural compared to urban to see what are higher in frequency? I wish I knew how that compared to Fst, but I assume that Fst equally weights urban and rural. There's gotta be an fst variation that only considers one population... but is there one that does so with genotype likelihoods??? prob not

Ruled out:
PCAdapt (infers pop clustering)
bayescan (requires genotype calls)
ohana (infers pop clustering)
